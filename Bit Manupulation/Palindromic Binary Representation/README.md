Problem Description

Given an integer A find the Ath number whose binary representation is a palindrome.

NOTE:

Consider the 1st number whose binary representation is palindrome as 1, instead of 0
Do not consider the leading zeros, while considering the binary representation.


Problem Constraints
 1 <= A <= 2104
