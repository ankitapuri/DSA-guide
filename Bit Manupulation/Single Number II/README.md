Given an array of integers, every element appears thrice except for one which occurs once.

Find that element which does not appear thrice.

Note: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity.

Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Input Format:

    First and only argument of input contains an integer array A
Output Format:

    return a single integer.
Constraints:

2 <= N <= 5 000 000  
0 <= A[i] <= INT_MAX
For Examples :

Example Input 1:
    A = [1, 2, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1]
Example Output 1:
    4
Explanation:
    4 occur exactly once
Example Input 2:
    A = [0, 0, 0, 1]
Example Output 2:
    1
